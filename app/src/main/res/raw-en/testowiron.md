# Testowy Testownik

Another PWR quiz application, like testownik-electron or Testownik Solvro, but for **mobile phones**.
The application was written by two students (idiots) as a project for android applications, hence
the forced "features", but who knows, maybe the ability to add YouTube videos to questions will be
used and implemented later in other quiz apps... **I doubt it**

Basic functions obviously remain the same, it's still a **fully functional quiz app**.
It accepts databases in the same format (for now it doesn't accept directly from zip), and supports
all question types.
